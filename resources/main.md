<p>- This is a lightweight mod that adds a new block to the game and changes the way you acquire Campfire and Soul Campfire Blocks.</p>
<p>- Now, instead of crafting campfires (you can enable the recipes back through config) on a Crafting Table, you will need to build them using Campfire Logs and a piece of Coal/Charcoal or Soul Sand depending on the Campfire.</p>

<h2>How to build a Campfire</h2>

<font size="4">
<p>- Since you can't craft campfires, you now need to use Campfire Logs.</p>
<p>- Campfire Logs are blocks that can be placed together, like Candles or Seapickles from Vanilla Minecraft.</p>
<p>- You can craft Campfire Logs using a Stonecutter and any type of log, other than stems / nether logs.</p>

<h1>FAQ</h1>

<font size="4">
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Will you port this mod to <strong>Forge</strong>?</span></p>
<p>I am a new, inexperienced developer and in my opinion, Fabric is much easier to code than Forge. 
Therefore a Forge Port is not planned for now but maybe in the future. <em>(If you want to port this mod to Forge, 
you can, I would be glad.)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Can I use this project in <strong>X</strong>?</span></p>
<p>This project is licensed under <a href="https://github.com/spacegoat3/BuildableCampfire/blob/1.18/LICENSE">MIT License</a>, a free and open-source license, which means you can use this 
project in nearly every way you want. But please remember to credit me if your project is public.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Will you port this mod to <strong>below 1.17</strong>?</span></p>
<p>Even though the programming language between 1.17 and 1.16 is not so different, I am still an inexperienced 
developer and I don't have much time in my personal life. So, I am sorry but the answer is no.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I found a <strong>bug</strong>! / I have a 
<strong>suggestion</strong>! What should I do?</span></p>
