<h2>Changes</h2>
<p>&bull; Made various changes to the config options and categories.</p>
<p>&bull; When chopped, logs drop 1 to 3 Campfire Logs (the amount is random), instead of dropping only 1.</p>

<h2>Additions</h2>
<p>&bull; Added compatibility with <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/oh-the-biomes-youll-go-fabric">Oh The Biomes You'll Go</a>.<br>
    <em>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - You can build two new Campfires, Boric Campfire, which requires Brim Powder and Cryptic Campfire, which requires Cryptic Magma Block.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Those Campfires also have their own config options similar to Vanilla Campfire's configs.
