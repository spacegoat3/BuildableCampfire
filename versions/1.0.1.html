<h2>Fixes</h2>
<p>- Campfires can only be build with 1 piece of their ingredient item.</p>

<h2>Additions</h2>
<p>- Campfire Logs can now be gathered by left-clicking a log/log-like block with an Axe on your hand while crouching.</p>
<p>- Players can now be turned into Campfire Logs by left-clicking onto them with an Axe, while crouching.</p>

<h3>Note</h3>
<p>Buildable Campfire currently isn't compatible with the new 1.18.2 version, sorry.
    It looks like there are some changes made to the game's tag feature, which is something this mod uses.
    I will try to update it as fast as I can but for now the highest compatible version is still 1.18.1.
    Have a nice day :]
